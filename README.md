# MathematicalPermutationSolver

With a list of Integers find the unique result of all permutations of the "+", "-" and "*" operators. For example with the input: (2,5), the result would be 7, 3 and 10; (2+5=7, 2-5=-3 and 2x5=10). This problem cannot be handled with recursion alone because you must account for order of operations when evaluating (multiplication has higher precedence then addition and subtraction). Try to complete this problem in less then an hour and win a prize!
