# MathematicalPermutationSolver

With a list of Integers find the unique result of all permutations of the "+", "-" and "*" operators. For example with the input: (2,5), the result would be 7, 3 and ten (2+5=7, 2-5=-3 and 2*5=10). This problem cannot be handled with recursion alone because you must account for order of operations when evaluation (multiplication has higher precedence then addition and subtraction).
